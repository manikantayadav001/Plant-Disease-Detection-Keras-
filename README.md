# Plant-Disease-Detection-Keras-

ABOUT

This project is aimed at detecting plant diseases using the Keras deep learning library. It utilizes convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to classify images of plant leaves and identify if they are healthy or infected with a specific disease.

LIBRARIES REQUIRED

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

numpy
pickle
cv2
scikit-learn
keras
matplotlib

DATASET

The dataset used for training and testing the model is the PlantVillage dataset, which consists of images of healthy plant leaves as well as leaves infected with various diseases. The dataset can be obtained from PlantVillage.

MODEL ARCHITECTURE

The model architecture used for this project is a CNN built with Keras. It consists of convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers.
